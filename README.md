# Advent of Code, 2021

This repo contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges for 2021. They are written in F# and focus on type system utilization and composability rather than performance or number of source code characters. Solutions are stored in F# script files and input data is stored in CSV files.
